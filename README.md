- About the project 

This project was made as a part of the Project Component of Course: Database Management Systems. The title of the project is 'Hostel Management System'. It was made to suit the scenario of VIT, Vellore. The main aim is to reduce manual effort that goes into updation of records in the Hostel Database. Generally, wardens update records in handwritten registers. Details like, Mess details, room details are written into Registers and the retreival of this data when needed, takes time. Our project helps the Wardens to easily insert and retreive data whenever needed!
